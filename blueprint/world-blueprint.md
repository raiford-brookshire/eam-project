  summary: |
    Raiford Brookshire operates at the intersection of artificial intelligence, cognitive architecture,
    and philosophical systems design. His research treats knowledge, belief, and perception as engineered
    architectures—each with their own feedback loops, incentive structures, and internal constraints.
    Rather than prescribing truth, his work examines how truth systems are built, maintained, and evolve
    over time within both human and machine cognition.

  guiding_principles:
    - Architecture first, ideology never.
    - Systems reveal truth through structure, not proclamation.
    - Transparency, adaptability, and intent alignment are hallmarks of epistemic integrity.
    - All architectures, including this one, are prototypes subject to revision.
